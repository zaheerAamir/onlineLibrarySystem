## NOTE‚≠ê:
* Once the Access token is generated copy the access token inside the double quotes and click on AUTHORIZE button on the top right corner and paste the token in this format:
Bearer <access_token>
* Once access token becomes invaild after 5 mins take the refresh token that was genrated at the time of login and go to the token route to generate a new access token from the refresh token.

## Securityüîí:
* The password's entered by users are stored in the DB in a secure format.
* When the user enters password the API genrates a random salt which is then conbined with the users password and hashed. This hash and salt is then stored in the DB. 
* All the Book search route and Book rent route are protected routes which can only be accessed by authorized users.

## Automated Email Notifications ü§ñ:
* A scheduled task runs every day at 11:00 AM, initiated by the server's cron job.
* This task is designed to automatically send email notifications to users whose book rental period is nearing its end.
